What is Chatbot?

Chat bot is a software application that uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to allow you to have a text-based or text-to-speech conversation.

Types of Chatbots:
1. Rule-based Chatbots: Rule-based chatbots are often known as decision tree bots since they understand queries using a tree-like flow. For each query, it has a set of predefined responses. They aren’t aware of the context of the user’s query.

2. AI based Chatbots: AI chatbots uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to understand the context and intent of a user’s query pattern and to create connections between different queries which are asked in different ways in order to provide a better response.


# Description 

In this Python Chatbot Project, we're creating a smart chatbot that can understand what users are saying and respond appropriately. This chatbot will remember the conversation context and give relevant answers. We'll use advanced techniques from deep learning to build a model that learns from examples of conversations.

To train the chatbot, we'll provide it with different topics or "intents," along with example phrases and suitable responses for each intent. The chatbot will use these examples to learn how to match user queries to the right intent and provide meaningful answers. It will also keep track of the conversation to stay on topic.

When you ask a question, the chatbot will figure out what you mean based on what it has learned, and it will give you a response that fits the context of the conversation. The responses it gives will be random but relevant to keep the conversation engaging.
